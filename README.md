# Drift Interactive Learning

Drift Interactive Learning is an adaptive, hands‑on, browser‑based environment for learning the Drift programming language.
The goal is simple: **teach Drift the way Drift is meant to be learned — through clarity, pragmatism, and real‑world problem solving.**

---

## What this project provides

### **1. A guided, interactive tour of the Drift language**
Learners progress through Drift concepts step‑by‑step:
- values, refs, and mutability
- arrays and iteration
- Drift’s error‑edge model
- structs and mutation
- traits and generics
- SSA and MIR visualizations
- plugins and signed modules
- FFI and ABI behavior

Each concept is paired with explanations, examples, and hands‑on problem‑solving.

---

### **2. Adaptive learning paths**
The journey starts with a short yes/no questionnaire that gauges experience:

- total beginner  
- intermediate programmer  
- advanced systems developer  

Based on answers, the site chooses the right track:

- **Track A** — Fundamentals  
- **Track B** — Core Drift concepts  
- **Track C** — Advanced system‑level features  

This ensures no one is overwhelmed or bored.

---

### **3. Fully interactive coding environment**
Every lesson includes an in‑browser editor backed by the Drift compiler:

- write and run Drift code  
- get instant compiler feedback  
- visualize SSA and MIR  
- solve exercises with automated checking  
- progress stored locally (no login required)

---

### **4. Real‑world, scenario‑driven learning**
Drift’s design comes from practical needs, so the examples reflect reality:

- data validation
- iteration over custom structures
- predictable error handling
- safe mutation through refs  
- parsing and formatting operations  
- C‑FFI bindings  
- loading signed plugin modules  

Learners build skills they can immediately apply to real Drift programs.

---

### **5. Capstone projects**
Each learning track concludes with a project:

- **Beginner:** simple CLI utility  
- **Intermediate:** structured data transformer  
- **Advanced:** plugin-enabled Drift module calling into C  

These projects help reinforce Drift’s core idioms and give learners something to show for their effort.

## Project status
This repository currently contains early conceptual documents and groundwork for the platform.  
As development continues, the repository will expand to include:

- complete architecture  
- onboarding flow  
- exercise framework  
- sandbox environment  
- contribution guidelines  

---

## Design documents
- **site-concepts.md** — core philosophy and conceptual overview  
More documents (architecture, onboarding, exercises, UI mockups) will be added soon.

---

## License
To be announced.
